/*

The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called Set.
Like an instance of Map, a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map, it does
not associate other values with those—it just tracks which values are part of
the set. A value can be part of a set only once—adding it again doesn’t have any
effect.
